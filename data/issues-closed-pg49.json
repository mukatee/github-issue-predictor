    "body": "In repeating start scenarios, there was a bug in the I2C driver for\nvarious NXP LPCxxxx parts which could allow an extra I/O from the\nprevious operation to leak through. The scenario I encountered which\ntriggered this bug went like so:\n- The higher level application code would first do an I2C write that\n  doesn't send a stop bit (use repeating start instead.)\n- The higher level application code would then issues an I2C read\n  operation which begins with a call to i2c_start().\n- i2c_start() would clear the SI bit (interrupt flag) at the top of\n  its implementation.\n- i2C_start() would then get interrupted right after clearing the SI\n  bit.\n  - While the CPU is off running the ISR code, the I2C peripheral\n    repeats the last byte written to I2CDAT and then sets the SI bit to\n    indicate that the write has completed.\n  - The ISR returns to allow the i2c_start() to continue execution.\n- i2c_start() would then set the STA bit but it is too late.\n- i2c_start() waits for the SI bit to be set but it is already set\n  because of the completed byte write and not because of the repeated\n  start as expected.\n\nFor me this bug would cause strange interactions between my ISRs and\nthe code using I2C to read from the MPU-6050 IMU. I would be getting\nvalid orientation data and then all of a sudden I would start receiving\nwhat looked like random values but I think it was just reading from the\nincorrect offset in the device's FIFO.\n\nIt appears that atleast one other person has seen this before but it\nwas never root caused since it required specific timing to reproduce:\n  https://developer.mbed.org/forum/bugs-suggestions/topic/4254/\n\nThis bug can be found in most of the NXP I2C drivers and this commit\ncontains a fix for them all. I however only have the LPC1768 and\nLPC11U24 for testing.\n\nMy fix does the following:\n- No longer clears the SI bit in the i2c_conclr() call near the\n  beginning of the i2c_start() function. It was this clear that\n  previously caused the problem as described above.\n- The second part of the fix was to instead clear the SI bit after\n  the STA (start) bit has been set with the i2c_conset() call.\n- The clearing of the SI bit should be skipped if there isn't an\n  active interrupt when first entering i2c_start(). If you clear\n  the SI bit when there isn't an active interrupt then the code\n  is likely to skip over the interrupt for the start bit which was\n  just sent and then allow the I2C peripheral to start sending the\n  slave address before it has even been loaded into the I2CDAT\n  register.\n\n**My Repro Case**\nI wrote two samples to reproduce this bug and verify that it was fixed by this change. The master sample is expected to be connected to a device which is running the slave sample.\n\nMaster test code which is a modified version of what I found in https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed/blob/master/libraries/tests/mbed/i2c_master/main.cpp  I modified it to read registers using repeated starts like I was doing with the MPU-6050 sensor. I then schedule an ISR to trigger at a random time in the range of when I expect the repeated start to occur:\n\n``` c++\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n//#include \"test_env.h\"\nvoid notify_completion(bool wasTestSuccessful) {\n    printf(\"Test completed - %s\\n\", wasTestSuccessful ? \"PASSED\" : \"FAILED\");\n}\n\n#define ADDR (0x90)\n\n#if defined(TARGET_KL25Z)\nI2C i2c(PTE0, PTE1);\n#elif defined(TARGET_nRF51822)\nI2C i2c(p22,p20);\n#elif defined(TARGET_FF_ARDUINO) || defined(TARGET_MAXWSNENV)\nI2C i2c(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);\n#elif defined(TARGET_EFM32LG_STK3600) || defined(TARGET_EFM32GG_STK3700) || defined(TARGET_EFM32WG_STK3800)\n#define TEST_SDA_PIN PD6\n#define TEST_SCL_PIN PD7\nI2C i2c(TEST_SDA_PIN, TEST_SCL_PIN);\n#elif defined(TARGET_EFM32ZG_STK3200)\n#define TEST_SDA_PIN PE12\n#define TEST_SCL_PIN PE13\nI2C i2c(TEST_SDA_PIN, TEST_SCL_PIN);\n#elif defined(TARGET_EFM32HG_STK3400)\n#define TEST_SDA_PIN PD6\n#define TEST_SCL_PIN PD7\nI2C i2c(TEST_SDA_PIN, TEST_SCL_PIN);\n#elif defined(TARGET_SAMR21G18A)\n#define TEST_SDA_PIN PA16\n#define TEST_SCL_PIN PA17\nI2C i2c(TEST_SDA_PIN, TEST_SCL_PIN);\n#elif defined(TARGET_SAMD21J18A)\n#define TEST_SDA_PIN PA08\n#define TEST_SCL_PIN PA09\nI2C i2c(TEST_SDA_PIN, TEST_SCL_PIN);\n#else\nI2C i2c(p28, p27);\n#endif\n\n#define I2C_MICROSECONDS_PER_BIT (1000000 / 100000)\n\nvoid isrHandler(void);\n\nint main() {\n    Timeout timeout;\n    bool success = true;\n    char counter = 0;\n    char reg = 0xA5;\n    char expectedCounter = 0x5A;\n    char writeCommand[] = { reg, expectedCounter };\n    char readCommand[] = { reg };\n\n    // Initialize counter.\n    i2c.write(ADDR, writeCommand, sizeof(writeCommand), false);\n\n    for (int i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; i++) {\n        // Schedule a Timeout object to fire\n        // ~(1 start bit + 8 address bits + 1 ack bit + 8 reg bits + 1 ack bit) = 2*8 + 3*1 = 16+3 = 19 I2C bit periods.\n        // Attempting to fire an interrupt between ack of register byte and repeated start. This used to cause\n        // problems since the I2C engine would send the register byte again rather than the repeated start due to a bug\n        // in the I2C driver which would clear the SI (interrupt) bit too early in i2c_start().\n        int triggerOffset = rand() % (8 * I2C_MICROSECONDS_PER_BIT);\n        int triggerTime = (15 * I2C_MICROSECONDS_PER_BIT) + triggerOffset;\n        timeout.attach_us(isrHandler, triggerTime);\n\n        // Read out counter where a repeated start is used for the read after the write.\n        i2c.write(ADDR, readCommand, sizeof(readCommand), true);\n        i2c.read(ADDR, &counter, sizeof(counter));\n        if (counter != expectedCounter) {\n            success = false;\n            break;\n        }\n        expectedCounter++;\n    }\n\n    notify_completion(success);\n}\n\nvoid isrHandler(void)\n{\n    // Waste 2 I2C bytes worth of time in this ISR handler.\n    wait_us(16 * I2C_MICROSECONDS_PER_BIT);\n}\n```\n\nSlave test code which is a modified version of what I found in https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed/blob/master/libraries/tests/mbed/i2c_slave/main.cpp  I modified it to support a register read/write protocol similar to MPU-6059 sensor. A write to the register sets an 8-bit counter and a read returns an auto-incremented version of the counter.\n\n``` c++\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\n#define ADDR (0x90)\n\n#if defined(TARGET_KL25Z)\nI2CSlave slave(PTE0, PTE1);\n#elif defined(TARGET_LPC4088)\nI2CSlave slave(p9, p10);\n#elif defined(TARGET_SAMR21G18A)\nI2CSlave slave(PA16, PA17);\n#elif defined(TARGET_SAMD21J18A)\nI2CSlave slave(PA08, PA09);\n#else\nI2CSlave slave(p28, p27);\n#endif\n\nint main() {\n    char command[2];\n    char counter = 0;\n\n    slave.address(ADDR);\n\n    while (1) {\n        // Read register address and its new value if a write register request.\n        bool wasWriteRequest = false;\n        int i2cState = slave.receive();\n        switch (i2cState) {\n        case I2CSlave::WriteAddressed:\n            memset(command, 0xFF, sizeof(command));\n            wasWriteRequest = !slave.read(command, sizeof(command));\n            break;\n        default:\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Handle the register write now if both register address and register value were written at once.\n        if (wasWriteRequest) {\n            counter = command[1];\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Now waiting for repeated start to begin register read.\n        bool registerReadDone = false;\n        while (!registerReadDone) {\n            i2cState = slave.receive();\n            switch (i2cState) {\n            case I2CSlave::ReadAddressed:\n                slave.write(&counter, sizeof(counter));\n                counter++;\n                registerReadDone = true;\n                break;\n            case I2CSlave::WriteAddressed:\n                registerReadDone = true;\n                break;\n            case I2CSlave::WriteGeneral:\n                registerReadDone = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI couldn't get the slave code to work without a small modification to the i2c_slave_read() function as well. I am not that confident in this change so I just list the diff here for anyone trying to run this repro case.\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/external/mbed/libraries/mbed/targets/hal/TARGET_NXP/TARGET_LPC176X/i2c_api.c b/external/mbed/libraries/mbed\nindex c7eea7c..68617d8 100644\n--- a/external/mbed/libraries/mbed/targets/hal/TARGET_NXP/TARGET_LPC176X/i2c_api.c\n+++ b/external/mbed/libraries/mbed/targets/hal/TARGET_NXP/TARGET_LPC176X/i2c_api.c\n@@ -346,8 +346,8 @@ int i2c_slave_read(i2c_t *obj, char *data, int length) {\n         status = i2c_status(obj);\n         if((status == 0x80) || (status == 0x90)) {\n             data[count] = I2C_DAT(obj) & 0xFF;\n+            count++;\n         }\n-        count++;\n     } while (((status == 0x80) || (status == 0x90) ||\n             (status == 0x060) || (status == 0x70)) && (count < length));\n```\n"

    "body": "This code appears to be used in the `analogin_read_u16()` functions in all TARGET_STM32:\n\n```\n    // 12-bit to 16-bit conversion\n    value = ((value << 4) & (uint16_t)0xFFF0) | ((value >> 8) & (uint16_t)0x000F);\n```\n\n It is supposed to convert (right-aligned) 12bit to (left-aligned) 16bit.  Starting from 0x0123 it produces 0x1231.  This seems like a bug, the correct value should be 0x1230.  \n\n(Regardless of what the correct value is though, it should probably not _duplicate_ one of the original half-bytes.)\n"

    "body": "(long commit message ahead. Sorry about that, it can't be helped.)\n\nThis commit changs targets definition from Python to JSON format, as\npart of the configuration mechanism implementation. There is a new file\nunder workspace_tools/ called \"targets.json\" which contains the target\ndefinitions. \"targets.py\" remains, but becomes a wrapper on top of\n\"targets.json\", with the same interface as before. This has the\nadvantage of not requiring code changes outside \"targets.py\".\n\nMost of the JSON definitions of targets were automatically generated by a\nscript (available upon request since it doesn't make a lot of sense to\ninclude it here), only those targets that had more than one parent in\nthe Python implementation were converted by hand. The target definitions\nshould be pretty self-explanatory. A number of things are different in\nthe JSON implementation (this is just a summary, check docs/mbed_targets.md\n(also part of this PR) for a more complete description):\n- \"program_cycle_s\" is now a value (as opposed to a function in the\n  Python implementation), since it only returned a number in all the\n  Python target implementations. The main definition that actually contains\n  some code (in class \"Target\") remains in target.py\n- array values in \"macros\" and \"extra_labels\" can be modified\n  dynamically. Values can be added using \"macros_add\" and\n  \"extra_labels_add\" or removed using \"macros_remove\" and\n  \"extra_labels_remove\". This mechanism is available for all attributes\n  with a list type, but it's currently enabled only for \"macros\" and\n  \"extra_labels\" to keep things simple.\n- \"init_hooks\"/\"binary_hook\" are now implemented in terms of a single\n  JSON key valled \"post_binary_hook\". The corresponding code is also in\n  \"targets.py\", under the various TargetCode classes (see for example\n  LPC4088Code in targets.py).\n\nJust like in the Python implementation, a target can inherit from zero,\none or more targets. The resolution order for the target's attributes\nfollows the one used by the Python code (I used\nhttp://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/2014/python-tutorial-understanding-python-mro-class-search-path as a reference for the implementation of resolution order).\n\nThis is obviously a very dangerous commit, since it affects all targets.\nI tested compilation for a number of targets (K64F, LPC1768, NRF51822)\nbut there's definitely a lot more to be done in terms of testing.\n\nI also tried to test in a different way: I wrote a script that imports the\nold (Python) and the new (JSON) implementations and verifies that the\nattributes in the old implementations exist and have the same values\nin the new implementations (it also verifies that the attribute\nresolution order is the same in the two implementations). If you're\ninterested, the script is here:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/bogdanm/c9d8cf34214109a4b9079befed6b3c0c\n\nAnd the results of running the script are below (note that the script\noutputs only the target names that were found to be problematic):\n\n```\nNRF51_MICROBIT_BOOT:\n    Resolution order is different in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51_MICROBIT_BOOT', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target', 'MCU_NRF51_S110']\n        new: ['NRF51_MICROBIT_BOOT', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target']\n    'extra_labels' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'NRF51_MICROBIT']\n        new: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT', 'NRF51_MICROBIT']\n    'macros' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT', 'TARGET_OTA_ENABLED', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_NRF51_MICROBIT', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\n        new: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_BOOT', 'TARGET_OTA_ENABLED', 'TARGET_NRF51_MICROBIT', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\nNRF51_MICROBIT:\n    Resolution order is different in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51_MICROBIT', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target', 'MCU_NRF51_S110']\n        new: ['NRF51_MICROBIT', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target']\n    'extra_labels' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110']\n        new: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K']\n    'macros' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\n        new: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\nNRF51_MICROBIT_OTA:\n    Resolution order is different in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51_MICROBIT_OTA', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target', 'MCU_NRF51_S110']\n        new: ['NRF51_MICROBIT_OTA', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_BASE', 'MCU_NRF51', 'Target']\n    'extra_labels' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'NRF51_MICROBIT']\n        new: ['NORDIC', 'MCU_NRF51', 'MCU_NRF51822', 'MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA', 'NRF51_MICROBIT']\n    'macros' has different values in old and new\n        old: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA', 'TARGET_OTA_ENABLED', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_NRF51_MICROBIT', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\n        new: ['NRF51', 'TARGET_NRF51822', 'TARGET_MCU_NORDIC_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_S110', 'TARGET_MCU_NRF51_16K_OTA', 'TARGET_OTA_ENABLED', 'TARGET_NRF51_MICROBIT', 'TARGET_NRF_LFCLK_RC']\nNOT OK: ['NRF51_MICROBIT', 'NRF51_MICROBIT_BOOT', 'NRF51_MICROBIT_OTA']\n```\n\nThe reasons for the above output are subtle and related to the\nextremely weird way in which we defined target data in the Python\nimplementation: we used both class attributes and instance attributes.\nThis can complicate resolution order quite a bit and those two levels\ndon't exist in JSON: there's only one attribute type (equivalent to\nPython's instance attributes). To make that work, I had to change the\ninheritance order of the above targets (that use multiple inheritance)\nwhich in turn changed the order of some macros and extra_labels (and of\ncourse the resolution order). No harm done: the values are the same,\nonly their ordering is different. I don't believe this causes any\nproblems for 'extra_labels' and 'macros'.\n\nThis method of testing has its limitations though; in particular, it\ncan't test the hooks. I'm opened to ideas about how to test this better,\nbut I think that we need to remember that this commit might break some\ntargets and keep an eye out for \"weird errors\" in the future.\n"

These pins are not specified in the TARGET_DISCO_L476VG /PeripheralPins.c file and therefore not available using the mbed API's.\n\nSomebody who understands the STM L4 mappings needs to work on this, because I have not sufficient experience with the port mappings.

    "body": "After the merge #1691 it's not anymore possible to use the command singletest.py with both uARM and ARM toolchain. The ARM part fail build when uARM is also used. If ARM is used alone, no problem.\n\nThe problem come from `arm.py`. The ARM_STD and ARM_MICRO class share a reference `self.flags` to `DEFAULT_FLAGS` and when ARM_MICRO object is created, it add, amongst others, `--library_type=microlib` in the `DEFAULT_FLAG` and then in the `self.flags` of ARM_STD object.\n\nA fix could be to copy the `DEFAULT_FLAGS` line 57.\n\n``` python\nself.flags = copy.deepcopy(self.DEFAULT_FLAGS)\n```\n\nAnother problem is that the uARM toolchain is always in timeout. Can you verify this point ?\n\nexemple with nucleo_l031k6 :\n[report_issue_l031k6.zip](https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed/files/248511/report_issue_l031k6.zip)\n"

When a new Issue is recorded, the ARM team will assign it to the corresponding vendor team.\nBut the best would be that some peoples in each vendor team have the rights to assign other peoples in their team. I don't know if it is possible ?\n\nIt would be also interesting that the vendor teams have also the rights to add some labels to track the progress of the fix (under_analysis, fix_on-going, etc...) and to be able to close their own issues when it is done. \n"

Please have a look at those changes. One possible solution would be to edit the declaration of `static P_TCB rt_tid2ptcb (osThreadId thread_id)` to be accessible outside of the file. That one would return tcb structure, which can than be read the same way as it was.\n\ncc @neilt6 @adamgreen @TomoYamanaka (if you can run the quick test on cortex-a, should not cause any regression)\n"

    "body": "Just noticed that Tickers quit firing on the LPC1549 at the 1:11:34 mark (when the 32-bit space overflows). Here's a code snippet to start the underlying μs timer at a high value and make testing easier:\n\n```\nus_ticker_init();\nLPC_RIT->COUNTER_H = 0x00000047;\n```\n## Update\n\nThis has just become a show-stopping bug on one of my projects, and needs to be fixed ASAP. I've investigated this issue, and it's stemming from the fact that the µs_ticker implementation on this target is using the 48-bit Repetitive Interrupt Timer (RIT) which is clocked at 72MHz. The 32-bit microsecond timestamps are being converted to 48-bit compare values that roll over at `0x0047FFFFFFB8`, long before the RIT's 48-bit counter rolls over. The RIT has a mask register, but I don't think it's useful here since the rollover point isn't an even power of 2.\n\n@0xc0170 Any ideas on what could be done to fix this?\n"

    "body": "@bcostm \nMeasuring VBAT sets the ADC_CCR_VBATE bit in ADC->CCR, and there doesn't appear to be a way with the HAL to clear it.\n\nIf it isn't cleared, VBAT remains connected to the ADC channel in preference to temperature, so VBAT readings are returned in place of temperature. See the note at the bottom of page 226 of the reference manual RM0368,  DM00096844.pdf\n\nI resorted to poking the register directly:\n\n```\nfloat read_temp(void)\n{\n    ADC_ChannelConfTypeDef sConfig = {0};\n\n    // Configure ADC channel\n    sConfig.Rank         = 1;\n    sConfig.SamplingTime = ADC_SAMPLETIME_84CYCLES;\n    sConfig.Offset       = 0;\n    sConfig.Channel      = ADC_CHANNEL_TEMPSENSOR;\n\n    HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel(&hAdc, &sConfig);\n\n    //disable Vbat from  ADC1_IN18 input channel, shared with temperature sensor\n    ADC->CCR &= ~ADC_CCR_VBATE;\n    //better added instead in stm32f4xx_hal_adc.c at line 1123, also line 753 in adc_ex.c?\n\n    HAL_ADC_Start(&hAdc); // Start conversion\n\n    // Wait end of conversion and get value\n    if (HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hAdc, 10) == HAL_OK) {\n        uint16_t value=HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hAdc);\n        HAL_ADC_Stop(&hAdc);\n        return  25.0f+(3.3f*(float)value/(float)ADCMAXVALUE-0.76f)/0.0025f;\n    } else {\n        return -273.15f; //hell has frozen over\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs per the comments in the above code, perhaps that bit should be cleared when configuring the ADC to read the temperature in stm32f4xx_hal_adc.c & stm32f4xx_hal_adc_ex.c ?\n"
