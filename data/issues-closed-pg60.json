Same with direction pin, etc.\nSo we want to set Invert too true to do this else we need to carry this flag through the whole source code.\n\nAnother example would be a switch/button. \nIf the user use a button which unpressed is closed(true) we can invert the signal.\nSo the Programm reads true if the button is pressed and the app logic can stay the same.\n"

But when I connect to the device the current consumption rise up to 1mA continuous consumption with small spikes when device receive/send packets. When disconnecting device once again start advertising and consumes 5uA in low-power mode.\nMy assumption is that when in connected state somewhere HFCLK Timer is used instead of low-power timer based on RTC1.\nCan someone check it out?\n"

In the online IDE it runs fine, but when using the sources in a offline compiler (emblocks 2.3) the program stops and hangs at the wait(1) statement. If i remove the serial comands the program run fine, but i'm unable to debugger (it runs fine until the wait() and never exit) In both cases if i check the stack it is stoped in the HardFault_Handler. This is the stack:\n\n| NR | Address | Function | File | Line |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0800396C | HardFault_Handler | startup_stm32f0xx.S | 200 |\n| 1 | FFFFFF9 | < signal handler called > |  |  |\n| 2 | 080015DE | NVIC_SetVector | cmsis_nvic.c | 47 |\n| 3 | 0800366A | us_ticker_init | us_ticker.c | 110 |\n| 4 | 080036C6 | us_ticker_read | us_ticker.c | 123 |\n| 5 | 0800158C | wait_us | wait_api.c | 28 |\n| 6 | 08001558 | wait | wait_api.c | 20 |\n| 7 | 08003898 | main | main.cpp | 18 |\n\nThe project was done with the mbed source from the trunk in git\n\nthe project is here: https://www.sendspace.com/file/auywkt\nand the issue on the mbed site here: http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/issues/10\n"

    "body": "Unfortunately, mbed doesn't feature versioning.\n\nWith continuous changes, mbed is difficult to work with, as there's no version number. So no one knows which version one's using. Two users may have incompatible mbed libraries without having an easy way to figure it out. The `MBED_LIBRARY_VERSION` doesn't provide enough information.\n\nI suggest releasing packaged versions, for example on a quarterly basis. Each quarter, the [ZIP master](https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed/archive/master.zip) is copied and named with the date —i.e. 2014-Q2—, saved and made available for download.\n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm using nRF51822-EK board for tests. I'm trying to implement button debouncing and I encountered a problem when trying to use InterruptIn and Tickers with last version of mbed-src.\nHere is example code:\n\n``` C\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\nDigitalOut led1(LED1);\nDigitalOut led2(LED2);\n\nInterruptIn button(BUTTON1);\nTicker ticker_button_debounce;\n\nvoid periodicCallback1(void)\n{\n}\n\nvoid button_debounce(void)\n{\n    led2 = !led2;\n    ticker_button_debounce.detach();\n}\n\nvoid button_hit_interrupt (void)\n{\n    led1 = !led1;\n    ticker_button_debounce.attach(button_debounce, 0.001);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    led1 = 0;\n    led2 = 0;\n\n    Ticker ticker_led1;\n    ticker_led1.attach(periodicCallback1, 1);\n\n    button.mode(PullUp);\n    wait(.001);\n    button.fall(&button_hit_interrupt);\n\n    while(1);\n}\n```\n\nWhen I push the button it should turn on/off LED1 and LED2 with 1ms delay between them.\nWhat I get:\n1. Device powered on, all leds is off.\n2. Push the button one time for a short time.\n3. LED1 will immediately turn on.\n4. LED2 will turn on after a few hundreds of milliseconds (it vary).\n5. Push the button second time.\n6. LED1 will turn off immediately.\n7. LED2 doesn't turn off.\n8. After this if I push button then LED1 will toggle, but LED2 will stay turned on.\nNext if I delete this line from code:\n\n``` C\nticker_led1.attach(periodicCallback1, 1);\n```\n\nThen all works fine and button_debounce() callback is called as normal every time.\n\nI tried to test this code without InterruptIN:\n\n``` C\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\nDigitalOut led1(LED1);\nDigitalOut led2(LED2);\n\nTicker ticker_led2;\n\nvoid periodicCallback1(void)\n{\n    led1 = !led1;\n}\n\nvoid periodicCallback2(void)\n{\n    led2 = !led2;\n    ticker_led2.detach();\n}\n\nvoid periodicCallback2_start (void)\n{\n    ticker_led2.attach(periodicCallback2, 0.001);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    led1 = 0;\n    led2 = 0;\n    Ticker ticker_led1;\n    ticker_led1.attach(periodicCallback1, 1);\n    Ticker ticker_start;\n    ticker_start.attach(periodicCallback2_start, 2);\n\n    while(1);\n}\n```\n\nAnd it works fine.\n\nCan someone figure out what could be the problem?\n"

    "body": "## Description\n\nSimple detection if file system file is actually file or directory was missing. To do this I followed POSIX's 'struct dirent' and added new standardized field d_type to store type flag.\nPlease see: http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=5&topic=dir for 'struct dirent'.\n### Things done:\n- Extended readdir() function by adding extra field in 'struct dirent' returned .\n  - Added new field in 'struct dirent'. New field 'd_type' was added to provide field which could store file type (file, directory, unknown etc.)\n  - Added dirent::d_type related file types in header file.\n- In code for now we only use this flags to determine if file is actually a file: \n  - DT_UNKNOWN - unknown (in our case mostly 'not supported'),\n  - DT_DIR - directory, \n  - DT_REG - regular file.\n- Added new test MBED_35 to cover status flag detection.\n  ## How to use it? :)\n\n``` c++\nSDFileSystem sd(D11, D12, D13, D10, \"sd\");\nint main()\n{\n    bool result = true;\n    DIR *dir;\n    struct dirent *ent;\n    if ((dir = opendir (\"/sd/\")) != NULL) {\n        // print all the files and directories within directory\n        while ((ent = readdir (dir)) != NULL) {\n            //////////////////// USAGE ////////////////////\n            if (ent->d_type == DT_UNKNOWN) {\n                // If we still get unknown SD card file type...\n                result = false;\n            }\n            else {\n                // Print file type and name\n                bool is_dir = (ent->d_type == DT_DIR);\n                const char *file_dir = is_dir ? \"dir\" : \"file\";\n                printf(\"%s:\\t%s\\r\\n\", file_dir, ent->d_name);\n            }\n            //////////////////// USAGE ////////////////////\n        }\n        closedir (dir);\n    } else {\n        // could not open directory\n        printf(\"Could not open directory\");\n        result = false;\n    }    \n    return result;\n}\n```\n### Future work (What we can add to file system functionality)\n\nThis functionality could be extended to support stat functionality from <sys/stat.h>, or at least part of it. This pull request is a simple base ground to do stuff below:\n- Add support for stat function: \n  - int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf).\n- Related to stat() structures:\n  - struct stat itself,\n  - At least S_ISDIR, S_ISREG macros,\n  - See: http://linux.die.net/man/2/stat.\n- Provide a way for users to get file creation time, modification time, file size, file attributes.\n### Testing results\n\n```\n[git:filesystem-stat-functionality*] c:\\Work\\mbed-przemek\\workspace_tools> git branch\n* filesystem-stat-functionality\n  host-test-improvements-part-2\n  master\n\n[git:filesystem-stat-functionality*] c:\\Work\\mbed-przemek\\workspace_tools> singletest.py -i test_spec.json -M muts_all.json -P -c cp\nBuilding library CMSIS (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding library MBED (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding library FAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding project SD_STAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nTargetTest::NUCLEO_F401RE::uARM::MBED_35::FileSystem stat functionality [OK] in 1.42 of 15 sec\nBuilding library FAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding project SD (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nTargetTest::NUCLEO_F401RE::uARM::MBED_A12::SD File System [OK] in 2.42 of 15 sec\nBuilding library FAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding project SD_PERF_STDIO (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nCompile: main.cpp\nLink: sd_perf_stdio\nElf2Bin: sd_perf_stdio\nTargetTest::NUCLEO_F401RE::uARM::PERF_1::SD Stdio R/W Speed [OK] in 5.42 of 15 sec\nBuilding library FAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding project SD_PERF_FHANDLE (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nCompile: main.cpp\nLink: sd_perf_fhandle\nElf2Bin: sd_perf_fhandle\nTargetTest::NUCLEO_F401RE::uARM::PERF_2::SD FileHandle R/W Speed [OK] in 5.42 of 15 sec\nBuilding library FAT (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nBuilding project SD_PERF_FATFS (NUCLEO_F401RE, uARM)\nCompile: main.cpp\nLink: sd_perf_fatfs\nElf2Bin: sd_perf_fatfs\nTargetTest::NUCLEO_F401RE::uARM::PERF_3::SD FatFS R/W Speed [OK] in 5.42 of 15 sec\nTest summary:\n+--------+---------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Result | Target        | Toolchain | Test ID  | Test Description              | Elapsed Time (sec) | Timeout (sec) | Loops |\n+--------+---------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F401RE | uARM      | MBED_35  | FileSystem stat functionality |        1.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F401RE | uARM      | MBED_A12 | SD File System                |        2.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F401RE | uARM      | PERF_1   | SD Stdio R/W Speed            |        5.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F401RE | uARM      | PERF_2   | SD FileHandle R/W Speed       |        5.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F401RE | uARM      | PERF_3   | SD FatFS R/W Speed            |        5.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n+--------+---------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\nResult: 5 OK\n\nCompleted in 39.05 sec\n```\n"

    "body": "After trying (unsuccessfully) for several hours to port a working project to the LPC1549, I've encountered numerous bugs with the serial_api implementation:\n- Attaching a TxIrq callback causes the microcontroller to lock up. I've narrowed this down to the following line: `obj->uart->INTENSET = (1 << ((irq == RxIrq) ? 0 : 2))`. As a result, the following program fails to run:\n\n``` c++\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\nDigitalOut led1(LED1, 1);\nSerial pc(USBTX, USBRX);\nchar buffer[1025];\nint idx = 0;\n\nvoid onTx()\n{\n    //Send a single byte\n    if (idx < sizeof(buffer))\n        pc.putc(buffer[idx++]);\n\n    //Toggle the LED\n    led1 = !led1;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    //Prepare the buffer\n    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(buffer); i++)\n        buffer[i] = 'A';\n\n    //Attach the tx interrupt\n    pc.attach(onTx, Serial::TxIrq);\n\n    //Start the transfer\n    onTx();\n\n    //Don't exit main!\n    while (1);\n}\n```\n- Attaching an RxIrq callback appears to work, but the microcontroller locks up when the first character is received. As a result, the following program fails to run:\n\n``` c++\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\nDigitalOut led1(LED1, 1);\nDigitalOut led2(LED2, 1);\n\nSerial pc(USBTX, USBRX);\n\nvoid onRx()\n{\n    // Note: you need to actually read from the serial to clear the RX interrupt\n    printf(\"%c\\n\", pc.getc());\n    led2 = !led2;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    pc.attach(onRx);\n\n    while (1) {\n        led1 = !led1;\n        wait(0.5);\n    }\n}\n```\n- serial_init() calculates 0x40048000 for LPC_USART2_BASE, but according to LPC15xx.h it is actually located at 0x400C0000. This will prevent USART2 from being used, and will likely cause a crash.\n"

Now together with some lines of code around it I think it could easily be fixed with an #ifdef guard. However on the other hand I would expect ARM to support core M4s with RTX. \n\nSo can anyone, maybe at mbed HQ, check if it has to be fixed manually or if there is a newer version that I cannot find?\n"

For now there are two group (types) of plugins: \n  - 'CopyMethod' and 'ResetMethod'.  First type of plugin implements various mbed platform flashing procedures, second is responsible for reseting mbed platform in order to perform e.g. test.\n  - For now test suite is using 'CopyMethod' plugins to copy generated target platform binary but with next pull request this functionality will be also moved to host tests where it belongs - host test will not only reset device and take ownership over device's serial port but will also copy (flash) mbed platform with binary.\n- Plugins are statically loaded during module **init**, but I will add functionality which is loading dynamically plugins from plugin directory if they are not registered.\n- Some plugins e.g. with support for MPS2 copy / reset are not yet stable but MPS2 related functionality was moved from test suite to plugin to consolidate one responsibility per plugin and remove unnecesary work flow from test suite.\n- Test suite should be as \"thin\" as possible so in future plugins for building will also be introduced and extracted from test suite itself.\n- Test suite should be as \"thin\" as possible so in future plugins for detecting / listing of connected platforms  will also be introduced as separate plugins / CLI tools..\n- In future plugins will be attached to command line help of test suite CLI so users can see which plugins attach to which command line switches.\n## Validation\n\nI've validated this solution on mbed enabled platform:\n\n```\nTest summary:\n+--------+---------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Result | Target        | Toolchain | Test ID   | Test Description                      | Elapsed Time (sec) | Timeout (sec) | Loops |\n+--------+---------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | DTCT_1    | Simple detect test                    |        0.57        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | EXAMPLE_1 | /dev/null                             |        3.51        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_10   | Hello World                           |        0.5         |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_11   | Ticker Int                            |       11.42        |       20      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_12   | C++                                   |        1.47        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_16   | RTC                                   |        4.84        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_2    | stdio                                 |        0.88        |       20      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_23   | Ticker Int us                         |       11.42        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_24   | Timeout Int us                        |       11.56        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_25   | Time us                               |       11.44        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_26   | Integer constant division             |        1.47        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_34   | Ticker Two callbacks                  |       11.44        |       15      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A1   | Basic                                 |        1.47        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A21  | Call function before main (mbed_main) |        1.47        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A5   | DigitalIn DigitalOut                  |        1.47        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A6   | DigitalInOut                          |        1.42        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A7   | InterruptIn                           |        9.43        |       10      |  1/1  |\n| OK     | NUCLEO_F072RB | uARM      | MBED_A9   | Serial Echo at 115200                 |        6.09        |       10      |  1/1  |\n+--------+---------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+-------+\nResult: 18 OK\n\nCompleted in 135.93 sec\n```\n"

    "body": "Hi,\nStarting [this revision](http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/rev/d73ca02bc818) mbed online compiller creates wrong hex files for nRF51822 projects.\nFor example if I create new empty project with only main.cpp file:\n\n```\n#include \"mbed.h\"\n\nDigitalOut myled(LED1);\n\nint main() {\n    while(1) {\n        myled = 1;\n        wait(0.2);\n        myled = 0;\n        wait(0.2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd import mbed-src library from [this revision](http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/rev/d73ca02bc818) then after project compiles it'll create wrong hex file with size 4476 bytes and I can't flash it into device with error:\nERROR: Error in opening or parsing mbed_blinky_NRF51822_.hex file.\nBut if I import mbed-src library from [previous revision](http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/rev/1c135c664c6b) with old softdevice then all works fine: compiler creates hex file with size 244960 bytes and I can flash it into my device without errors.\n\nI compiled blinky example with mbed-tools and checked it on my board and it works fine. So it's online compiler fault.\n\nHere is [this issue reported on mbed.org.](http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/issues/9)\n"

    "body": "## Description\n\nThis pull request is following previous one. \nChanged host test to support run() and test() method tandem. \nWhen users will trite their own host tests in future they can just overload test() method and return proper result status which will be handled by Test::run() method.\nCurrent host test improvement are done so host test code is shorter, cleaner and faster. Also control flow goes to one place from each host test.\n- Host test refactoring: cleaned a bit functionality of host tests. Forced test() function in DefaultTest to be method returning test result.\n- Cleaned pyFlakes issues with unused imports\n- Minor style improvement\n- This refactoring is also preparing host tests for plug-in architecture improvements.\n- Still NET_ related tests can be refactored.\n  ## Verification Results\n  Before pull request I've ran tests with new host test implementation in CI server.

Host test refactoring: created separate enum like class for test result strings\n3. Use special function (notify) to print and flush so data stdout data from host test in immediately transferred to test suite via queue.\n- Please ignore tests NET_1 and NET_7 failing, they are failing because mbed.org address changed to developer.mbed.org.
