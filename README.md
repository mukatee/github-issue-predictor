# github-issue-predictor

This is a little demonstrator I built to predict assigned components for github issues for [ARM mBed OS repo](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os).

Read more about it [here](https://swenotes.wordpress.com/2018/06/12/predicting-issue-categories-on-github/).

There is also more advanced version to similarly predict the component for the [Qt](http://bugreports.qt.io) bug database.
