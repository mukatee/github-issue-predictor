In the long run we want to support building all essential qt modules like we do now by invoking the qt5 configure script which in the end uses qmake.

For now we could try adding a CMakeLists.txt file to the qt5 repo which would try to build qtbase and qtsvg, because those are the ones that were tested so far.
